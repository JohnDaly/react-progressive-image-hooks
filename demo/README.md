# React Progressive Image Hooks - Demo

Before running the demo, be sure to build the `react-progressive-image-hooks` project, by running the following command from the project root directory: 
>yarn build

Next you will need to install the dependencies for the demo application by running the following command in the `/demo` directory:
>yarn install

Once `react-progressive-image-hooks` has been built, you can run the demo application with this command (remember to run it from within the `/demo` directory):
>yarn start

## Note - Browser caching + Network speeds:

Due to browser caching and connection speeds, the progressive loading effect might not be apparent in the demo. To see it more clearly, try disabling your browser's cache, and throttle the network connection speed (you can do this in Chrome and Firefox via the Network tab in the web inspector). You can try different combinations to see what the effect will look like.
